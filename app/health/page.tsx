          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Start Gradually</h3>
          <p>
            If you're new to any of these wellness activities, start slowly and gradually increase intensity or
            duration. Listen to your body and avoid pushing yourself too hard too quickly.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">Stay Consistent</h3>
          <p>
            Consistency is more important than intensity. It's better to do a moderate amount regularly than to do an
            intense session occasionally.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">Balance is Key</h3>
          <p>
            A balanced approach to wellness includes physical activity, proper nutrition, adequate rest, stress
            management, and social connection. Try to incorporate all aspects into your routine.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">Listen to Your Body</h3>
          <p>
            Pay attention to how your body responds to different activities. If something causes pain or discomfort,
            modify or stop the activity and consult a healthcare professional if needed.
